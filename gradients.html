            You may be familar with functions in
            <span class="special">2D </span> space. For example, you might have
            seen this function before: \(f(x) = x^2\). We can represent inputs
            and outputs in a <span class="special">2D </span>space.

          <p>
            A fundamental aspect of gradients is that they typically deal with
            <span class="special">dimensions </span> higher than
            <span class="special">2D </span> <br /><br /><br />
            For example, this function \(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\) is a function in
            3D space. We have two inputs that can be represented on our previous
            2D plane, and one output that can be represented on a third axis.
            So, this new third up-down axis is simply the output of the function
            just as the y-axis was the output of the
            <span class="special">2D </span> function.

          <p>
            Gradients are simply derivatives in higher
            <span class="special">dimensions </span> such as these.
            <br /><br /><br />
            Recall what a derivative is for the previous 2D function \(f(x) =
            x^2\). <br /><br /><br />
            The derivative with respect to x is \(f'(x) = 2x\). This tells us
            that the output of the function changes by a factor of 2 for every
            change in the input.<br /><br /><br />
            If x is 1, the function is increasing at a rate of 2. If x is 2, the
            function is increasing at a rate of 4.<br /><br /><br />
            Basically, it gives us a sense of how fast the function is going to
            increase or decrease at a given point. <br /><br /><br />
            If we plot this derivative at a few points paired with a line that
            is <span class="special">tangent </span> to the function, you can
            see that this line has the same slope of the function at that point.
            The slope gets steeper and steeper because \(f(x) = x^2\) is getting
            larger and larger. In a way, you can think of the derivative as a
            measure of the steepness of the line that is
            <span class="special">tangent </span> to the function at a given
            point.

            How do we apply this to higher

          </h2>
          <p>
            In higher <span class="special">dimensions </span>, we compute
            gradients as partial derivatives which involves treating all
            variables except one as a constant before applying
            <span class="special">standard derivation rules </span>
            <br /><br /><br />
            For example, consider the function \(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\).
          </p>
          <p>
            The partial derivatives of this function are: \(\frac{\partial
            f}{\partial x} = 2x\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y\).

          <p>
            But what do these partial derivatives mean? <br /><br /><br />
            The partial derivative \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) tells us
            how the output of the function changes with respect to the input x.
            <br /><br /><br />
            The partial derivative \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) tells us
            how the output of the function changes with respect to the input y.
            <br /><br /><br />
            Just as the derivative of \(f(x) = x^2\) told us how the output of
            the function changes with respect to the input x, these partial
            derivatives tell us how quickly the output of the function increase
            or decrease as x or y increases or decreases.
            <br /><br /><br />
            In this case, if we x is 1, the function is increasing at a rate of
            2 and if y is 2, the function is increasing at a rate of 4.

          <h2>So what is a gradient?</h2>
          <p>
            A gradient is simply a vector of these partial derivatives.
            <br /><br /><br />
            It combines all of the information about how the function changes
            with respect to each input into a single construct that has some
            nice properties. <br /><br /><br />
            For the function \(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\), the gradient is \(\nabla f
            = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial
            f}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2x \\ 2y
            \end{bmatrix}\).<br /><br /><br />
            To illustrate these properties, lets consider our function again
            \(f(x,y) = x^2 y^2\). with gradient \(\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix} 2x
            \\ 2y \end{bmatrix}\).<br /><br /><br />
            Let's plot the gradient of this function at a few points.
            <br /><br /><br />
            At the point (1, 1), the gradient is \(\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix} 2
            \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\). At the point (-1, 1), the gradient is \(\nabla
            f = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\). At the point (1, -1),
            the gradient is \(\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -2
            \end{bmatrix}\). At the point (-1, -1), the gradient is \(\nabla f =
            \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}\). We've included a few more
            gradient vectors below as well.
          </p>
          <div class="video-container">

          </div>
          <p>
            Interestingly, the gradient vectors point towards the direction that
            will increase \(f(x,y)\) the most which in this case is outward
            <br /><br /><br />
            By direction, we mean the direction in which the input x or y
            increases.
            <br /><br /><br />
            This is a fundamental property of gradient vectors. They point in
            the direction such that increasing the input variables in that
            direction will result in the greatest increase in the output of the
            function. Remember this!
