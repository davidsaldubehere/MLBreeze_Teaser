          <p>
            The first algorithm that we will look at is the K-Nearest Neighbors
            algorithm which is an algorithm that requires a set of objects (we
            will use dots in these examples) and corresponding labels (red or
            blue) to be able to classify new objects based on their similarity
            to the objects in the dataset. <br /><br /><br />
            The K-NN algorithm is based on the idea that objects that with
            similar features are likely to be in the same class.
          </p>

          <p>
            The notion of similarity is not always easy to define, but for most
            cases we will use some type of distance metric to measure the
            similarity between objects. <br /><br /><br />

          <p>
            Let's look a the simplest case of the K-NN algorithm, the 1-NN
            algorithm. (We will define what K means in a second)
            <br /><br /><br />
            The 1-NN algorithm is simple. Given a new object, we find the
            closest object in the dataset and classify the new object as the
            same class as the closest object in the dataset.

          <p>
            Easy enough! But what does K mean then?<br /><br /><br />

            K is simply the number of neighbors that we will consider when
            classifying a new object. <br /><br /><br />

            For example, since K = 1 in the 1-NN algorithm, we only consider the
            closest object to the new object. <br /><br /><br />

            If K = 3, we consider the 3 closest objects to the new object and
            classify the new object as the class that is most common among the 3
            closest objects. <br /><br /><br />

            If there are only 2 types of objects in the dataset, then we would
            pick the class that is most common among the 3 closest objects.

          <h2>3-NN</h2>
          <p>
            Here's an example demonstrating how the 3-NN algorithm works.
            <br /><br /><br />
            In this example, the 3 closest objects to the new object are
            considered and the new object is classified as the class that is
            most common among the 3 closest objects. <br /><br /><br />
