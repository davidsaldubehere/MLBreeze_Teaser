        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>
          Machine learning theory is hard, but it doesn't have to be.

          <br /><br />
          Our goal is to create a platform that can help anyone learn the basics
          of modern machine learning theory without a background in advanced
          mathematics or computer science. <br />
          <br />
          We believe that by providing visualizations and removing unnecessary
          mathematical jargon, we can make machine learning theory accessible to
          everyone.

        <h1>Top Priorities</h1>
        <p>
          Our top priority is to create great content, share it, and iterate

          <br />

          With this foundation, we hope to improve our web platform and provide
          features such as a forum, GPU enabled coding environment, and an
          expert helpline. <br />
