# ML Breeze

This is the source code for the [mlbreeze.org](https://mlbreeze.org) website; a proposal for a non-profit machine learning education platform. 

We were unable to continue the project due to 
time and funding contraints, so we decided to make the code public in case someone finds the content useful or would like to revive the project. 

Feel free to contact us [here](https://mlbreeze.org/contact) if you have any questions
